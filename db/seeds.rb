# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).

# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: "Star Wars" }, { name: "Lord of the Rings" }])
#   Character.create(name: "Luke", movie: movies.first)

# We create a user to be able to login into our back office and test it

# Erica is an employee!
Employee.create!(user_id: erica.id, address_id: erica_address.id, phone: "5141231234", email: "erica.ger@codeboxxacademy.com")

# We create another user who's not an employee to be able to test the Back Office access
